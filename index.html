            The 2020 presidential election has been filled with mis-information,
            barriers to voting, and threats of undermining the democratic
            process of voting. We are grateful for Election Officials at county
            and state levels who have committed to protect our democracy and run
            the elections as smoothly as possible. We want the same.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            We are asking that County Election Officials publicly declare your
            pledge to count all eligible votes and make the voting process as
            transparent and fair as possible given the current voting laws. We
            want people to know that they should feel encouraged to vote and
            that you will play your role in defending the voting rights they
            have. Please view and sign the pledge below.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            We are also asking that members of the public pledge to be Election
            Defenders by publicly declaring support to Election Officials to
            stop any possible harassment from people wanting to interfere in the
            collection and counting of votes. We are concerned about scenarios
            like the “Brooks Brothers Riot” in 2000 where Miami-Dade recount
            workers were intimidated to stop counting votes. We don’t want to
            see that happen and ask that members of the public pledge to stand
            up against this type of harassment and interference. Election
            Defenders also pledge to make sure that Election Officials are doing
            as much as possible to make the process go smoothly and if not, push
            them to correct their course. Please read and sign the pledge below.
